# Enrollware Order Automation

Automates filtering and processing TC Product Orders in Enrollware, updating them on ecard.hearts.org, and sending confirmation emails. Streamlines repetitive workflows for efficiency.

## Features

- **Secure Authentication:** Credentials loaded from environment variables

2. **Navigate:** Opens TC Product Order page
3. **Filter:** Excludes orders with "redcross" or "complete" status
4. **Process:** Processes remaining orders on ecard.hearts.org
5. **Finalize:** Updates status and sends confirmation email
